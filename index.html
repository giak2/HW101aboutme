    <h1>Hello there! My name is <em><span>김지아</span></em>...</h1>
    <h3>"<em>Ji</em>" is derived from <span class="group1">"智 - Wisdom"</span> and "<em>A</em>" is derived from <span class="group1">"雅 - Clear"</span>.</h3>
    <h2>I am a fourth year Art major at CTSA.</h2>

    <p>As a resident of VDCN, I sometimes get lucky and spot raccoons, rats, and rabbits hanging out around the area! Super cute. I love the wildlife!
    <br>I enjoy cooking with my roommates, spending time with my friends, and making art at the studios on-campus.<br>
    <p>After I started living on-campus, I began meal-prepping and making food at home more often.
    <p>I learned a lot from this one Youtuber and grew up watching their videos!</p>
